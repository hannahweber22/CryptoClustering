# CryptoClustering

# In the CryptoClustering challenge, I used Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day prices. 

# To use: open the Crypto_Clustering jupyter notebook using PythonData and run the script. At the end of the file, the visualize and compare the results section shows composite plots to contract the elbow curves and cluster plots. 

# Analysis: The elbow plots show the best value for k equal to 4. The impact of having fewer features to cluster the data using K-means presents the data in a different way that can be easier/ harder to visualize what is going on.
